Field Freezing Experiment
Cat - July 2017

The goal of this experiment is to expose seedlings to false spring events without removing them from the forest. 

Create an in-field growth chamber:
1. Use a big styrofoam freezer
2. Attempt to use dry ice
3. Clamp freezer around entire seedling for a few minutes and establish false spring event

Monitor individuals across multiple years. 

Grant and Harvard Forest sites with the option to add additional sites in future years
1. Freeze half of the individuals between budburst and leafout
2. Monitor phenology and record height
3. Return to individuals in August and record height, collect leaves for SLA, record DBH if possible, and use either chlorophyll meter or Ciras-2

In the following years, return again in spring to record phenology and again in August to collect and record traits data.

Hypotheses:
1. Individuals exposed to False Spring events will grow at a slower rate than those not exposed to false spring events
2. Individuals exposed to false spring events the first year will initiate budburst later the following year than those not exposed to a false spring event.
